    question: 'How does the 25% savings guarantee work?',
    answer:
      'Once you authorize Pay Bills With Us to manage your monthly bills, our agents negotiate provider promotions, enroll you in hidden loyalty offers, and bundle eligible services. We guarantee at least 25% savings off your documented monthly total or we credit the difference back to your account.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What information do you need to get started?',
    answer:
      'Create an account with your contact details, last four of SSN, date of birth, and service address. This allows our agents to verify your identity with providers when setting up or transferring plans.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is my personal data secure?',
    answer:
      'Yes. We use bank-grade encryption, isolate admin and agent tools, and require multi-factor verification before any account changes occur. Sensitive credentials are stored in a segregated vault accessible only to vetted agents.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I add multiple bills under one account?',
    answer:
      'Absolutely. After sign-up you can share each provider, account number, and due date with your assigned agent. They will consolidate payments so you only fund a single wallet each month.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What if I move or need to change providers?',
    answer:
      'Reach out through the agent portal or by phone. Your agent will update service addresses, transfer plans, or onboard new providers without interrupting your savings guarantee.',
  },
